# Heart Rate Device

This repository contains code and assets related to a heart rate monitoring device.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

Previously, this repository contained a configuration file (`core/config.py`) with sensitive data (such as passwords or credentials). That file has now been **permanently removed from the entire Git history** using [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).

All keys and passwords have been invalidated and should no longer be considered valid or usable.

To avoid such issues in the future:

- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Store secrets in a `.env` file
- Add `.env` and config files to `.gitignore`
